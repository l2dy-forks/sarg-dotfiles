Hello there!

The dotfiles here are managed with [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]]. I have documented how to boostrap
from this repo on a new laptop in [[http://sarg.org.ru/blog/guix-restore-drill/][a blog post]]. Earlier I have used [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to
manage symlinks in the ~$HOME~, but nowadays I have a declarative =guix home=
[[./guix/home.scm][configuration]] for my home directory.

My base apps are:
- emacs ([[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][doomemacs]], [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]], [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][mu4e]], org-mode, [[https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el][telega]], [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]])
- [[https://www.qutebrowser.org/][qutebrowser]]
- [[https://syncthing.net/][syncthing]]
- [[https://mpv.io][mpv]] + [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]]
